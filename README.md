This is an Image Segmentation algorithm using PDf thresholding and MRF generation.

There are two versions:
1. Scalar algorithm - non-vectorized, non-parallelized.
2. Optimized algorithm - vectorized, instruction and functional level parallelized.

We wrote the two to compare the benefit of performance optimization methods we learned in real application.

The results will come out soon.
